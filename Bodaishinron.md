## Introduction
L'Ajari Daikôchi a dit:
1. Eveil
Si une personne possède des facultés et des connaissances supérieures, elle ne doit pas rechercher le Dharma des non-bouddhistes ou des deux véhicules inférieurs (c'est-à-dire des śrāvakas et des pratyekabuddhas). Il doit au contraire être magnanime, courageux, insouciant, cultiver le véhicule du bouddha et susciter ce type de pensée :
> Je désire rechercher l'illumination suprême et ne cherche pas d'autres réalisations.
2. Les mérites acquis grâce à l'éveil
Parce que l'état mental de ce vœu est inébranlable, le palais de Māra tremble et les bouddhas des dix quartiers le reconnaissent ; et, demeurant constamment dans les royaumes des dieux et des humains et éprouvant un plaisir suprême, le pratiquant n'oublie pas ce vœu mais s'en souvient où qu'il naisse. Il fait le vœu de perfectionner les corps de la bodhicitta par le yoga (c'est-à-dire de réaliser l'union avec les bodhisattvas en pratiquant le yoga). avec les bodhisattvas en méditant sur le maṇḍala). Cet état de réalisation est appelé l'éveil de la bodhicitta car ces déités sont toutes identiques au corps du Bouddha Mahāvairocana.
3. Pratique
Celui qui convoite la gloire ou les honneurs produit ce type de pensée et agit de manière à l'atteindre ; celui qui recherche la richesse produit ce type de pensée et agit de manière à l'atteindre ; et celui qui veut faire le bien ou le mal entretient ce type de pensée et accomplit ce qu'il a voulu. Par conséquent, celui qui recherche la bodhi doit éveiller la bodhicitta et cultiver les pratiques de la bodhi. Après avoir éveillé la bodaishin, il faut connaître les marques de ces pratiques. Ces marques sont de trois sortes. Les bouddhas et les bodhisattvas qui, dans le passé, demeuraient dans le royaume causal de l'éveil et avaient éveillé la pensée de la bodhicitta, considéraient : (1) la vérité suprême (Skt. paramārtha-satya), (2) le vœu et (3) samādhi comme leurs principes directeurs, ne les oubliant jamais au cours de la réalisation de la boddhéité. Ils ont réalisé la « bouddhéité dans le corps présent » (Jp. sokushin jōbutsu) par le seul dharma du mantra. Ce dharma est appelé Samādhi Dharma (c'est-à-dire le dharma réalisé en samādhi). Il est absent des autres écoles et n'est pas mentionné par elles. Nous parlerons d'abord du vœu, ensuite de la vérité suprême et enfin du samādhi.

## Voeu
1. Definition
Tout d'abord, le vœu. Le pratiquant doit constamment adopter ce type de pensée :
> J'apporterai le bienfait et la paix à tous les êtres sensibles du monde sans en laisser aucun derrière moi, en les observant dans les dix directions comme s'ils étaient des êtres vivants. sans en laisser aucun derrière moi, en les observant dans les dix directions comme s'ils étaient moi-même.
Le terme « bienfait » signifie exhorter tous les êtres sensibles et leur permettre de demeurer paisiblement dans le royaume de la paix, de demeurer paisiblement dans le royaume de l'illumination suprême, sans jamais essayer de les sauver au moyen du dharma des deux véhicules.
2. Tathāgatagarbha
The mantra practitioner should know that all sentient beings are endowed
with the nature of the tathāgatagarbha (buddha-nature) and are capable of
abiding peacefully in supreme enlightenment. Therefore the mantra practitioner does not employ the Dharma of the two vehicles to cause sentient
beings to be saved. Thus the Avataṃsaka-sūtra says, “There is not a single
sentient being who is not endowed with the wisdom of the Tathāgata.” But
because of delusion, distortions, and attachment, sentient beings do not
realize enlightenment. If they part from delusion, then knowledge of all particulars, spontaneous knowledge, and unobstructed knowledge are readily
at hand.
3. Peace of Mind
“Peace of mind” means that because a practitioner already understands that
all sentient beings will ultimately realize buddhahood, he would not dare
to be arrogant. Furthermore, through the teaching of great compassion, he
takes the most appropriate means to bring about the ultimate salvation of
all sentient beings. He offers what is sought by them, even his own life,
unsparingly, to enable them to live in peace and to bring joy to them. Since
he is already intimate with them, sentient beings will have confidence in
his words. It is indeed through intimacy that guidance is possible. Even if
sentient beings are ignorant, they should not be coerced into salvation. A
mantra practitioner should lead them by skill-in-means.

## Chapitre III
Supreme Truth
1. Definition
Second, supreme truth refers to the insight that all dharmas are without
essence. Why do they lack an essence?
2. Ordinary People
Ordinary people are attached to fame, profit, and the necessities of life; they
devote themselves to achieving material security and recklessly indulge in
the three poisons and five desires. The mantra practitioner should truly abhor
and abandon these notions and practices.
3. Non-Buddhist Religious
Practitioners
The non-Buddhist practitioners are attached to their own lives: with the aid
of drugs they attain life in the palace of the immortals. Some consider rebirth
in heaven to be the ultimate. The mantra practitioner should observe the nonBuddhist’s view of salvation as follows: even if karmic forces are exhausted,
one cannot part from the triple world because the afflictions remain to be
extinguished, the seeds of retribution from the past are not destroyed, and
evil thoughts repeatedly arise. Thus non-Buddhists sink into the ocean of suffering from where it is difficult to escape. You should know that the Dharma
of the non-Buddhists is like an illusion, a dream, or a flickering flame.
4. Followers of the
Two Vehicles
Of the followers of the two vehicles, śrāvakas cling to the Dharma of the
four truths while pratyekabuddhas cling to the Dharma of twelve-stage causation (pratītyasamutpāda). Realizing that the four elements (earth, water,
fire, and wind) and the five aggregates (skandhas) will ultimately be destroyed,
113
The Bodhicitta Śāstra
they arouse a profound distaste for them: they destroy the notion of the reality
of self and cultivate the original Dharma, eventually attaining their due level
of realization—arriving to great nirvana and regarding this as the ultimate
destination.
The mantra practitioner should thus observe: though the followers of the
two vehicles destroy the notion of the reality of self, they still cling to the
notion of the reality of dharmas, and although they purify their minds (manas),
they do not understand anything beyond that. Further, by realizing the fruit
of their respective paths—the product of eons of practices—and by destroying
both body and mind, they end up reaching nirvana, which is like a vast empty
space, deep and tranquil. Those of determined nature (śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas) find it difficult to awaken bodhicitta and are only able to give
rise to it after completing the full term of kalpas. Those of indeterminate
nature do not speak of kalpa limits. Meeting the proper conditions they
directly convert to the Mahayana, depart from the “city of mirage,” and transcend the triple world because of their long-developed faith in the Buddha.
And through the skill-in-means of buddhas and bodhisattvas and through
skill-in-means, they will finally awaken the great mind. From the ten stages
of faith—going through the following stages and passing through the time
of three incalculable kalpas of arduous practices—they will realize buddhahood. It is already clear that the wisdom of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas
is inferior and is not to be indulged in.
5. Mahayana Practitioners
Furthermore, among sentient beings, there are those who are awakened to
the Mahayana and carry out bodhisattva practices, leaving no Dharma practice
uncultivated. They practice through three incalculably long kalpas, observing
the six perfections and innumerable bodhisattva practices to the fullest extent,
and then realize the buddha fruit. These are graded practices that require a
considerable span of time.
The mantra practitioner, having observed the limits of the former, again
gives rise to the motivation to bring benefit and comfort to all sentient beings
in their worlds without leaving anyone behind. By the determination generated
from his great compassion, he permanently transcends the sphere of the practices of the non-Buddhists and the followers of two vehicles. He furthermore
114
Chapitre III
cultivates the supreme teachings of yoga that enable entry into buddhahood
directly from the level of an ordinary person. Thus he transcends the bodhisattva stages. He also deeply understands that all dharmas are without essence.
Why do they lack an essence? The gist of this was explained above.
6. Refutation of the Reality
of Dharmas
Now, the Dharma of the lost way arises from deluded conceptualization, and
continues to develop. This brings about immeasurable and limitless afflictions
and transmigration through the six destinies. If one awakens, deluded conceptualizations are terminated and various dharmas are extinguished. Therefore
they lack self-nature. Furthermore, the compassion of buddhas arises from
the truth to save and embrace sentient beings. Like a physician who prescribes
the most appropriate medicine for a disease, the Buddha bestows various
teachings according to various beings’ capacities and each affliction receives
its own antidote. But just as someone would employ a raft to reach the other
shore but would abandon it once they have reached that shore, we should likewise abandon the Dharma that enabled us to conquer delusion, because dharmas have no essence. As the Mahāvairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtra says, “Dharmas are without marks. Their marks are the marks of empty space.”4 The
realization of this state of understanding is called the supreme bodhi.
7. The Emptiness of
Dharmas
You should know that all dharmas are empty of an essence. Why? Having
realized that dharmas are originally unarisen, the essence of the mind is automatically thus. Hence, not having the view of body and mind, one abides in
quiescent equality, the cognition the ultimate truth, which disallows retrogression. If delusion does arise, one would recognize it but would not follow
it; when delusion ceases, the mind as the source of all dharmas will become
void. Here myriad virtues are perfected and their marvelous function is
infinite. Therefore the buddhas of the ten directions consider the supreme
truth and practice of the vow as their discipline. Those equipped with this
state of mind are capable of turning the Dharma wheel and bringing benefits
to both themselves and others.

The Bodhicitta Śāstra
8. Canonical Sources
Thus the Avataṃsaka-sūtra says:
Compassion is the light and wisdom is its guiding principle,
 the two merge as skill-in-means.
In the purified mind of faith-and-understanding,
 there is the immeasurable power of the Tathāgata.
Unobstructed knowledge manifests:
 This knowledge is self-realized, not acquired through the aid of others.
All complete, he is identical with the Tathāgata,
 having awakened to the supreme state.
If a child of the Buddha awakens for the first time,
 with a precious jewel-mind such as this,
He will surpass the stage of ordinary people
 and enter the level of buddha practices.
He is born in the household of the Tathāgata,
 an infallible clan.
He is equal to the buddhas,
 and, at the end, he will perfect supreme bodhi.
Having realized this state, even slightly,
 he enters the stage of joy, pramuditā.
His mind immovable,
 he is like the king of a great mountain.
4
The Avataṃsaka-sūtra further says, “In each ground (bhūmi), from the
first ground up to the tenth ground, great compassion is the base.”6
The Amitāyurdhyāna-sūtra says, “Buddha-mind is the great compassion.”7
The Nirvāṇa-sūtra says, “O Cunda, though your body is of mortals, your
mind is the same as buddhas.”8 It further says:
The Medicine King, the Buddha, pities the beings of the world;
 His body and wisdom are tranquil.
Within the Dharma of no-self, he realizes the true self;
 Therefore I pay homage to the Supreme One.
Having awakened, there is no distinction
 between initial and ultimate enlightenment.
116
573c
Chapitre III
Between the two, it is initial enlightenment that is difficult.
 For not yet having enlightened oneself, one is supposed to
 enlighten others.
Thus I pay homage to initial awakening.
If one has realized initial awakening, he is the master of gods and
 humans, surpassing the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha.
This type of awakening transcends the triple world.
 Therefore it is called “unsurpassed.”9
The Mahāvairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtra says, “Bodhicitta is the cause,
compassion its root, and skill-in-means its end result.”10
117

Chapitre IV
Samādhi
1. Definition
Third, samādhi: How should a mantra practitioner, having thus contemplated,
realize supreme bodhi?
2. The Meditation
on the Moon
You should know that all beings inherently dwell in the great enlightenment
of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, who represents the attributes of bodhicitta;
that though they are endowed with bodaishin they are also bound by the
afflictions of greed, hatred, and delusion; that through the great compassion
of the buddhas—who, through their wisdom of skill-in-means, teach this
profound secret yoga—the practitioner is able to meditate on the discs of the
sun and moon within his mind.
Through this meditation, he sees his original state of mind (bodhicitta),
which is tranquil and pure like the light of a full moon covering space without
discrimination. This state of mind is called complete enlightenment (the perfection of the cognizer); it is also called pure dharmadhātu (the perfection
of the cognized); and it is also called the sea of the perfection of the wisdom
of reality (the union of the cognizer and the cognized). Its ability in samādhi
to contain a variety of immeasurable precious jewels is like a full moon’s
ability to contain its pureness and brilliance.
Why? Because all beings are endowed with the mind of Samantabhadra:
one sees one’s own mind like the disc of the moon.
Why is the disc of the moon employed as a simile? Because a perfect full
moon is like bodhicitta. The moon disc has sixteen phases. This is a metaphor
for the sixteen bodhisattvas, from Vajrasattva to Vajrasaṃdhi, realized in yoga.
3. The Five Buddhas
Among the thirty-seven deities of the Vajradhātu Maṇḍala, each buddha of
119
The Bodhicitta Śāstra
the five quarters represents one type of cognition. The five buddhas are:
(1) Akṣobhya Buddha of the east. He is also called “indestructible cognition” (vajra-jñāna) because he perfects mirrorlike cognition (ādarśa-jñāna).
(2) Ratnasaṃbhava Buddha of the south. He is also called “investiture
cognition” (abhiṣeka-jñāna) because he perfects the cognition of equality
(samatā-jñāna).
(3) Amitābha Buddha of the west. He is also called “lotus cognition”
(padma-jñāna) because he perfects the cognition that deals with discriminative
observation (pratyavekṣaṇā-jñāna). He is also called the “cognition that
turns the Dharma wheel” (dharmacakra-pravartana-jñāna).
(4) Amoghasiddhi Buddha of the north. He is also called the “cognition
of perfecting all works” (karma-jñāna), i.e., the cognition to implement
insight into practice (kṛtyānuṣṭhāna-jñāna).
(5) Mahāvairocana Buddha of the center. He is the fundamental buddha
because he represents the cognition of the world of Dharma (dharmadhātu).
4. The Four Pāramitābodhisattvas
From the four buddha-cognitions (i.e., the first four buddha-cognitions)
emanate the four perfecting pāramitā-bodhisattvas who are offered to the
fifth buddha, Mahāvairocana. The four pāramitā-bodhisattvas of Mahāvairocana are: (1) Vajra-pāramitā, (2) Ratna-pāramitā, (3) Dharma-pāramitā,
and (4) Karma-pāramitā.
They are the mothers who give birth to and nurture all deities of the three
time periods.
5. The Sixteen Mahābodhisattvas
From here, the vow hand gestures (mudrās) are perfected and the four buddhas
emanate from Dharmadhātu Mahāvairocana. Each buddha of the four quadrants embraces four bodhisattvas:
(1) Akṣobhya Buddha of the east embraces the four bodhisattvas Vajrasattva, Vajrarāja, Vajravāśin, and Vajrasādhu.
(2) Ratnasaṃbhava Buddha of the south embraces Vajraratna, Vajraprabha,
Vajraketu, and Vajrahāsā.
120
574a
Chapitre IV
(3) Amitābha Buddha of the west embraces Vajradharma, Vajratīkṣṇa,
Vajrahetu, and Vajrabhāṣa.
(4) Amoghasiddhi Buddha of the north embraces Vajrakarma, Vajrarakṣa,
Vajradaṃṣṭra, and Vajrasaṃdhi.
Each of the buddhas of the four quarters thus embraces four bodhisattvas,
making a total of sixteen great mahā-bodhisattvas.
Of the thirty-seven deities, excluding the five buddhas, the four pāramitābodhisattvas of Mahāvairocana, the four saṃgraha-bodhisattvas Vajrānkuśa,
Vajrapāśa, Vajrasphoṭa, and Vajrāveśa, offered to the four buddhas by Mahāvairocana, and the eight pūjā-bodhisattvas Vajradhūpā, Vajrapuṣpā,
Vajrālokā, Vajragandhā, Vajralāsyā, Vajramālā, Vajragītā, and Vajranṛityā,
offered to the four buddhas by Mahāvairocana—of which the last two groups
(i.e., the four saṃgraha-bodhisattvas and the eight pūjā-bodhisattvas) are a
later development—we are thus talking about the sixteen bodhisattvas encompassed by the buddhas of the four quarters. So the Mahāprajñāpāramitāsūtra says:
There are sixteen meanings of emptiness—from the emptiness of the six
sense organs and the six sense fields (adhyātma-śūnyatā) to the emptiness
of self-nature and the emptiness of the emptiness of self-nature (abhāvasvabhāva-śūnyatā).
11
6. The Sixteen Phases of the
Moon and Their Implication
in Meditation
There is an essence of purity, fully prepared to perform practices, in the mind
of all sentient beings. This essence is extremely subtle, pure, and bright.
Though it transmigrates within the six destinies (gati), it does not change,
like the light-essence that does not change in any one of the sixteen phases
of the moon. A part of the light of the moon is absorbed by the sun, such as
at the time of the new moon; at that time, the nature of its light is not manifested, but afterward the moon arises, increasing its brightness day by day,
until it reaches fullness after the fifteenth day.
Therefore, a meditation practitioner should first arouse the essence of
brightness (bodhicitta), which is inherent in the mind by meditating on the
121
The Bodhicitta Śāstra
syllable “A”; and he should gradually purify and brighten it and realize the
ultimate cognition of non-arising (ādyanutpāda-jñāna).
7. The Meaning of the
Syllable “A”
The syllable “A” signifies that all dharmas are originally non-arisen. In interpreting the syllable “A,” the commentary on the Mahāvairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtra gives five meanings:
(1) The syllable “A” signifies the thought of enlightenment, bodhicitta.
(2) The syllable “Ā” signifies the practice: for realizing enlightenment,
bodhi.
(3) The syllable “AM” signifies the realization of enlightenment.
(4) The syllable “AḤ” signifies supreme enlightenment, parinirvāṇa.
(5) The syllable “ĀH” signifies wisdom complete with skill-in-means.
Furthermore, we can match the meaning of the syllable “A” with the
words “to reveal,” “to indicate,” “to realize,” and “to enter”—terms found
in the Lotus Sutra.
(1) “To reveal” means to reveal the Buddha’s wisdom-based view, that
is, to reveal his bodhi and nirvana as in the case of the syllable “A,” which
signifies the thought of enlightenment (bodhicitta).
(2) “To indicate” means to indicate the Buddha’s wisdom, as in the case
of the syllable “Ā,” which signifies practice, the indicator of bodhi.
(3) “To realize” means to realize the Buddha’s wisdom, as in the case of
the syllable “AṂ,” which signifies the realization of bodhi.
(4) “To enter” means to enter the realm of the Buddha’s wisdom, which
signifies nirvana. It refers to “all-complete perfection” and corresponds to
the syllable “ĀH,” meaning the perfection of the wholesome skill-in-means.
8. The Practice of Meditation
on the Syllable “A”
The meditation on the syllable “A” is designed to praise the essence of that
syllable—symbolizing the five inherent meanings of bodhicitta. This statement
of praise is described in verse as follows:
The eight-petal white lotus is within easy reach;
 the syllable “A” manifests its pure brilliance.
122
574b
Chapitre IV
The mudrā with hands placed together incorporates both meditation
 and wisdom.
 It invites the tranquil wisdom of the Tathāgata.
12
One who encounters the syllable “A” should meditate on it with true
determination and contemplate on the perfect brilliance of pure consciousness:
if one sees it just for a moment, he is the one who has realized supreme truth;
if one constantly sees it, he will enter the first bodhisattva stage (bhūmi); if
this vision gradually increases, then it pervades the limits of the dharmadhātu,
and becomes equal to space, he would be at perfect liberty, complete with
knowledge of all particulars. The one who cultivates yogic contemplation
should cultivate the practices of the three mysteries in all detail and realize
the essence of the five stages to realize buddhahood.
9. The Three Mysteries
and the Five Stages to
realize Buddhahood
The three mysteries are:
(1) Physical action (kāya-guhya): performing mudrās to summon the hosts
of deities.
(2) Vocal action (vāg-guhya): chanting mantras, making each word completely clear and understanding them without error.
(3) Mental action (mano-guhya): abiding in yoga, coming into union with
the pure moon that has reached its fullness, and meditating on bodhicitta.
The five stages to realize buddhahood are:
(1) The stage of penetration, becoming aware of bodhicitta.
(2) The stage of cultivating bodhicitta.
(3) The stage of perfecting the vajra-mind, the realization of the union of
“knower” and “known.”
(4) The stage of perfecting the vajra-body, the realization of the physical
union of a human being and the Buddha.
(5) The stage of realizing the supreme bodhi and the attainment of the
adamantine body.
If one has completed these stages, one has perfected the body of the presiding deity.
123

Chapitre V
Enlightenment
What is fully revealed in one’s body and mind is the body and mind of
Samantabhadra. What is fully realized is identical to what the buddhas of
the ten directions have realized. Though the period of time required for
practice and realization might differ throughout the ages when one awakens,
there should be no concept of time: the mind of an ordinary person is like a
closed lotus bud and the mind of the Buddha is like a blooming lotus bud.
If this meditation is perfected, all things within the ten directions, whether
pure or defiled, as well as the distinction between sentient beings of the six
destinies, between the practices of the three vehicles, among the processes
from creation down to destruction of the worlds of the three time periods,
between various kinds of karma of sentient beings, among the marks of the
causal aspect of bodhisattva practices, and among the buddhas of the three
time periods—all will be revealed and one will realize the body of the Buddha
and fulfill all the practices and vows of Samantabhadra. Therefore the Mahāvairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtra says, “The true state of mind such as this is
what the past buddhas have proclaimed.”12
Question: It was said that because the adherents of the two vehicles cling
to dharmas, they do not realize buddhahood. Now, one is encouraged to cultivate bodhicitta and samādhi. What is the difference?
Answer: Because the adherents of the two vehicles cling to the notion of
the reality of dharmas, they will consummate this kind of meditation only
after a long period; they will remain submerged in the realm of emptiness
and stagnate in the realm of tranquility; they would be limited by kalpa
requirements as a condition to enlightenment. But they would subsequently
be awakened to this great state of realization riding through the gate of the
practices of goodness in a distracted state (the exoteric approach), they will
pass through innumerable kalpas. For these reasons, these practices should
be abandoned. They should not be relied upon.
125
574c
The Bodhicitta Śāstra
Now, though the mantra practitioner already has rejected the reality of
self and dharmas and has acquired the wisdom to correctly see reality, he is,
nevertheless, incapable of realizing the Tathāgata’s knowledge of all-knowledge, because of the separation from his original nature from beginningless
time. He therefore seeks the profound path, practices the three mysteries in
due order, and enters the buddha stage from the stage of an ordinary person.
The meditation of the Mantra Dharma enables the practitioner to penetrate
the true nature of the buddhas, to be aware of the true nature (dharmakāya)
of the buddhas, to realize the wisdom of the world of dharmas (dharmadhātu-svabhāva-jñāna), and to perfect four aspects of Mahāvairocana
Buddha—dharmakāya, the truth body; saṃbhogakāya, the means body; nirmāṇakāya, the historically transformed body; and niṣyandakāya, the body
that enters the six destinies in order to save all beings. The practitioner who
has not yet observed the meditation of the Mantra Dharma would not gain
these insights. Therefore one should cultivate the understanding of the Mantra
Dharma.
Hence, the Mahāvairocanābhisaṃbodhi-sūtra says, “Perfection originates
from the mind.”14
The Vajraśekhara-sūtra says:
When Sarvārthasiddha Bodhisattva first sat in the vajra-seat and attained
the supreme path, he was endowed with the state of the buddhas and realized its fruition.
15
If someone at the present time, with determination, practices the teachings
as prescribed by the Mantra school, the content of this meditation would be
revealed to him even without his leaving his seat and he would perfect the
body of the Buddha.
Therefore the Mahāvairocana-sūtra, in the “Chapitre on the Rites of Worship” says,
If the practitioner’s strength does not increase, he should dwell in the
realm of the Mantra Dharma and only meditate on bodhicitta.
The Buddha explained that embodied in the Mantra Dharma are ten
thousand virtues that enable the practitioner to gain insight into the Dharma
of bodhicitta.
16
126
Chapitre V
This is because bodhicitta is able to contain the virtues of all buddhas. If
this bodhicitta is realized through practice, the practitioner will then become
the master of all teachings; if he returns to the realm of inherent enlightenment,
he will dwell in the buddha land of mysterious adornment. Without arising
from his seat, he would perfect all buddha works.
Bodhicitta is praised as follows: if a person who seeks the wisdom of the
Buddha realizes bodaishin with the body born of his father and mother, he
will immediately realize the state of great enlightenment (mahābodhi).

3 The terms “gradual” and “sudden” were conceived of in fifth-century China, after
Kumārajīva had translated many Mahayana sutras. The Chinese, faced with the task
of sorting out the mass of texts, developed the panjiao system of classifying and evaluating the contents of these texts. The panjiao systematizers conceived of the limits
of the gradual approach and the superiority of sudden approach. The gradual approach
relies on reason and inference, establishes proposition, and subjects it to a philosophical
critique in order to validate its truth-claim, while the sudden approach relies on
intuition and direct cognition and validates its truth-claim experientially.
